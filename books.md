## HTTP Testing in R

<https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/>

I wrote this online only book with MaÃ«lle Salmon. 

It covers many aspects of testing R packages that contain HTTP requests. It focuses on a set of packages that help R users manage HTTP requests: [vcr][], [webmockr][], [httptest][]/[httptest2][] and [webfakes][].


[vcr]: https://docs.ropensci.org/vcr/
[webmockr]: https://docs.ropensci.org/webmockr/
[httptest]: https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/
[httptest2]: https://enpiar.com/httptest2/
[webfakes]: https://webfakes.r-lib.org/
