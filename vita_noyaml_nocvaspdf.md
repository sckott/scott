Education
---------
* 2012 Ph.D Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2009 M.A. Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Rice University
* 2003 B.S. Biological Sciences, California State University

Programming
------------
* R >> I have developed R software for 7 years, for research projects, and as packages (see them [on GitHub](https://github.com/schamberlain)). I co-founded a developer collective to make R software tools for scientists called rOpenSci ([http://ropensci.org/](http://ropensci.org/)). 
* Python >> I have programmed in Python for about a year now, and am relatively comfortable throughtout the language, having used it for a variety of simulations. 
* Ruby >> I have picked up Ruby in the last year as well, and am getting more comfortable (e.g. a) I have deployed [an app to Heroku](http://rodash.herokuapp.com/roapi) to monitor the many web APIs that we at rOpenSci consume, and b) I wrote a tiny gem to get Bibtex style references by inputting a DOI [here](https://github.com/SChamberlain/doiref)).
* HTML/CSS >> I use HTML often for my own website and blog, and occasionally customize CSS. 
* Databases >> I am familiar with and use many databases, including SQL (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (CouchDB).


Projects/Working Groups
------------
* 2012-pres [DataONE - Community Education and Engagement Working Group](http://www.dataone.org/working_groups/community-education-and-engagement)
* 2012-pres British Ecological Society (BES) Digital Strategy Working Group
* 2011-pres rOpenSci: co-founded developer collective to make R (#rstats) packages to facilitate use of open source journals and data sets. [Website](http://ropensci.org/); [Code](https://github.com/ropensci).
