1. Recology blog: 
	1. add Pascal as an author
	2. add rOpenSci image button with link to About sidebar
	3. Fix category links!!
2. Videos for Journal of Ecology blog: need to figure out why guest voice is super quiet. Perhaps something wrong with the .mov file extension when importing to YouTube. 
3. Edit `loghistplot` function [here][] to include more options
	1. allow users to manipulate colors
	2. include points along with histogram
	3. more?
