<pre>-basic: SELECT * FROM tablename
-JOIN: (add columns)
	-inner join: 'INNER JOIN COLUMN ON TABLE.COLUMN '
	-left join:
-UNION: (add rows)
	-append results of one statement to another
	-
-DISTINCT: ~ unique
-top 5 rows 'top 5 ???'
-WHERE: ?????
-'*' means choose all columns (alternatively, specify columns by name
-select YEAR() AS Year_Date, MONTH() [where 'AS' specifies a new column]
-UPDATE: update a table
-DELETE: delete values
-dates are single quoted (can't use double quotes)
-column names are not quoted

-Indexing: makes searching faster
	-create new table, go to indexing options
	-don't index all columns, just ones to e.g., join by
	-don't necessarily need to index columns though, unless perhaps large tables

-Write your own function: 'new multiline statement' and it provides a template

-Loops:</pre>
