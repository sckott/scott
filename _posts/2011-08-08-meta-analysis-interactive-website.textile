Possibly create a website where people submit their datasets to the site:

-the code takes data and,

-makes visualization plots of the data,

-pulls in figures or tables or sections where data retrieved from each primary paper

-examine figures/tables/etc from each primary paper

-put in a web based data capture interface (Graph Click is a nice example) for data acquisition down the road

-What about coyright concerns (use only open source meta-analysis data sets at first, e.g., from PLoS journals)

-Could this site interface with sites like Dryad via API's?
