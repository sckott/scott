Here, I argue that Cory Doctorow's analogy of publishers insistence on DRM as digitial lysenkoism, is an apt anology to describe many academic publishers. 

On Cory Doctorow's podcast [Craphound][here], [Cory read an essay][this] he published in [Publisher's Weekly][pw] titled "Digital Lysenkoism". 

In this essay, Cory suggests that publishers inistence on DRM ([digital rights management][drm]) is like digital lysenkoism. 

What is lysenkoism? It is basically descendant from Lamarckism, which is a discredited theory that an organism can pass on characteristics acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. 

I think this applies to academic publishers, in the following context: Academic publishers, (e.g., Elsevier) have been peddling a very old publishing model for a long time. Academic publishers surely created value when reprinting scientific articles was extremely expensive.  

In the present, publishing costs are falling, while publisher profits are rising. Publishers are trying to tack on this (comments sections that no one uses) and that (paywalls, charging $30 per paper), like DRM for book publishers, in attempt to survive and make more profits. Instead, they need to evolve, or be pushed out of the way in a struggle for existence against newcomers such as PLoS and PENSOFT.
