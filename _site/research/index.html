<h4 id="network-structure-of-plant-pollinator-interactions">Network structure of plant-pollinator interactions</h4>

<p>Plant-pollinator networks have been collected across Canada at many sites. We are asking various questions about how network (=species interaction) structure of these communities relates to the traits of the species and their phylogenetic history.</p>

<h4 id="pollinator-biodiversity">Pollinator biodiversity</h4>

<p>What are the hotspots of pollinator diversity in Canada? How does pollinator biodiversity compare in pristine vs. human-altered landscapes? We will address these kinds of questions.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-influence-of-agriculture-on-spatially-variable-selection-on-floral-traits-in-helianthus-sunflower">What is the influence of agriculture on spatially variable selection on floral traits in Helianthus (sunflower)?</h3>

<p>Very little work has been done to incorporate the influence of crops into selection on floral traits. This is despite the fact that most species probably occur in close proximity to human disturbance of some kind, whether development, pollution, habitat fragmentation, or agriculture. I am using wild and cultivated Helianthus annuus to explore how agriculture influences selection on floral traits via biotic pathways of mutualists vs antagonists.</p>
