I'm currently looking for work. My last role was as a Senior Data Engineer with <a href="https://www.deck.tools/" target="_blank">Deck</a>. Prior to Deck I worked with  <a href="https://ourresearch.org/" target="_blank">OurResearch</a> as the product owner/developer on <a href="https://unsub.org" target="_blank">Unsub</a>, a web application helping research librarians unsubscribe from paywalled journals. Before that, I was co-founder of <a href="https://ropensci.org/" target="_blank">rOpenSci</a>, a non-profit creating open source tools in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>. My first professional role was as postdoctoral scholar at Simon Fraser University in Canada.

Previously, I received my M.A. & Ph.D. at <a href="https://biosciences.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a>. There I studied a range of topics, including: ant-plant interactions, pollination, population and community ecology, species interaction networks, and evolutionary ecology.
