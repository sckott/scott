#### I'm currently a Senior Data Engineer with <a href="https://www.deck.tools/" target="_blank">Deck Tools</a>.

#### After rOpenSci, I worked with  <a href="http://ourresearch.org/" target="_blank">OurResearch</a> as the product owner/developer on <a href="https://unsub.org" target="_blank">Unsub</a>.

#### I was a co-founder of <a href="http://ropensci.org/" target="_blank">rOpenSci</a>, a project to facilitate open science by creating open source tools witin the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> programming environment.

#### From 2012-2014 I was a postdoc in the Biology Department at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada.

#### Before the postdoc at Simon Fraser University I did my master's degree and Ph.D. training at <a href="http://eeb.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a> in Houston, TX.  There I studied a range of topics, including: ant-plant interactions, pollination, population and community ecology, species interaction networks, and evolutionary ecology.</p>

#### In addition to doing science, I was involved in a number of projects. I was the blog editor for the Journal of Ecology until December 2013. I was on the <a href="http://www.dataone.org/working_groups/community-education-and-engagement" target="_blank">Community Education and Engagement Working Group at DataONE</a>, and helped organize <a href="http://ievobio.org/">iEvoBio 2014</a>!
