Stuff needed to get a RStudio AMI going on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

## Starting from scratch 

### Find a public AMI of RStudio, start an instance, then in the terminal:

+ Update R to newest version by adding `deb http://<my.favorite.cran.mirror>/bin/linux/ubuntu oneiric/` to your `sources.list` file - 
+ back it up first `sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bckup`, 
+ then run `sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://cran.stat.sfu.ca//bin/linux/ubuntu oneiric/'>>/etc/apt/sources.list"`. 
+ Change oneiric to your version of Ubuntu (see [here](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/)). 
+ Then run `sudo apt-get update`, then `sudo apt-get install r-base` to update R.
+ helpful sites for install on ubuntu: 
		+ http://blogs.helsinki.fi/bioinformatics-viikki/documentation/getting-started-with-r-programming/installingrlatest/
		+ http://help.nceas.ucsb.edu/installing_r_on_ubuntu
+ Follow instructions on [RStudio's website](http://rstudio.org/download/server) to update RStudio server version.
+ Add new user by `sudo adduser username`.  This is the credential you will use to login in to RStudio in the browser on the AMI.

### I need some stuff on ubuntu to do web calls, which I do a lot of.  

####  Install dependencies for RCurl 
+ Learned from [here](http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/FAQ.html) that once inside the Linux box on the AWS instance, run `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`. 

#### Install dependencies for XML
+ Learned from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7765429/unable-to-install-r-package-in-ubuntu-11-04), that once inside the Linux box on the AWS instance, run `sudo apt-get update` then `sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev`. 

#### These will allow to do `library(RCurl)` and `library(XML)`, both important for making web calls. 

****** 
### Save the AMI as an image you own.  Then you can start up this image any time you want with whatever size instance you want.
