### Reasoning
Made a phylogeny ecologist style for a paper I am working on in which we are asking questions about how species traits and phylogenetic history influence species interaction networks (plant-pollinator). 

There were about 500 species to make a phylogeny for, including birds and insects, and many species that were bound to end up as large polytomies. I couldn't in reasonable time make a molecular phylogeny for this group of species, so made one ecologist style. If only there was a Phylomatic for other taxonomic groups...look out for [phylotastic](http://phylotastic.org/) and [opentreeoflife](http://opentreeoflife.org/)

***************
That is, I: 

1. Created a topology using [Mesquite software] from published phylogenies, then
2. Got node age estimates from [timetree.org](http://timetree.org/) (p.s. Wish I could use the new [http://datelife.org/](http://datelife.org/), but there isn't much there quite yet), then
3. Used bladj function in phylocom to stretch out the branch lengths based on the node estimates.

Unfortunately, this process can't all be collected in an R script, but below is the process I followed, which hopefully makes it more reproducible.

### TimeTree used to get node ages for phylogeny
+ [website](http://timetree.org/), [here's a link](https://raw.github.com/SChamberlain/scott/gh-pages/data/nodeages.csv) to the node ages I used.

### Used bladj command in phylocom to stretch out branches to get branch lengths, as:
`./phylocom bladj > out.txt`
